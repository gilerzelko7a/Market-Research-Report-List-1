<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Valve</li><li>Tissue Valve</li><li>Mechanical Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial valve market consists of three main types: transcatheter valves, tissue valves, and mechanical valves. Transcatheter valves are minimally invasive options delivered via catheters, primarily used for patients at high surgical risk. Tissue valves, made from biological materials, provide a natural function but generally have a shorter lifespan than mechanical ones. Mechanical valves, constructed from durable materials, ensure longevity but can require lifelong anticoagulation therapy. Each type addresses specific patient needs and clinical scenarios within cardiovascular treatment.</p></p>
