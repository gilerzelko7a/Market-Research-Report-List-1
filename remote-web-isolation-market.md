<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Remote Web Isolation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DOM Mirroring</li><li>Pixel Reconstruction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Remote Web Isolation (RWI) enhances cybersecurity by safely isolating untrusted web content. There are two primary market types: **DOM Mirroring** and **Pixel Reconstruction**. DOM Mirroring captures the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, allowing users to interact with a safe, functional clone without exposing the original site to potential threats. In contrast, Pixel Reconstruction renders web pages as images, preventing users from interacting directly with the content, thus offering stronger defense against malicious code while maintaining usability.</p></p>
