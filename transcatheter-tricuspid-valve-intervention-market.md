<p><strong>The Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Intervention Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Interventional Treatment of Tricuspid Regurgitation</li><li>Interventional Treatment of Tricuspid Stenosis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Intervention market focuses on minimally invasive procedures for treating tricuspid valve disorders, primarily tricuspid regurgitation and tricuspid stenosis. Interventional treatment of tricuspid regurgitation involves techniques that repair or replace the valve to reduce backflow of blood, improving heart function. In contrast, interventional treatment of tricuspid stenosis addresses the narrowing of the valve, enhancing blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Both approaches aim to alleviate symptoms and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
